                        other turtles, they can regulate their own body temperature because layers of fatty tissue insulate their bodies. The English name ‘’Leatherback’’ refers to their unique carapace. Leatherback turtles can dive to depths 
                        of 1500 meters (about half the height of Mount St. Helens) in search of deep-sea jellyfish. At these depths the Leatherback’s body is subjected to tremendous water pressure, but its flexible shell does not break and so

                              The Hawksbill turtle gets its English name from its narrow birdlike beak, which it uses to catch animals hiding in small crevices. Hawksbill turtles sometimes eat toxic sponges. 
                              Instead of being poisoned, Hawksbills can actually store the toxins in their own flesh. If human eats the flesh of a Hawksbill turtle, he can die from acute food poisoning. 
                              The Hawksbill turtle is now highly endangered because for centuries, people around the world have killed them for their shell. Once cleaned and polished, the shell is crafted
