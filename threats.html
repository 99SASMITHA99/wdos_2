                 <p>Predators represent the main natural threats for marine turtles. Feral dogs. Water monitors, land monitors, jackals, wild boars, mongooses, several
                 Species of ants and crabs can be considered as natural predators for marine turtle eggs and hatchlings on nesting beaches (Photo no. 31). Killer whales/ 
                 Orca whales, Sharks and other reef fishes and sea birds' prey on hatchlings in the sea. Sometimes harsh weather conditions such as storms, tornados, 
                 draughts, and El Nino phenomenon can cause damage to the laid turtle nests.

                 <h3 id="h3">Kill for Meat</h3>
                 <p>Marine turtles are killed for their meat in many countries. In Sri Lanka, slaughter of marine turtles for meat is a traditional practice in many 
                       coastal areas. Slaughter of nesting adult females directly effects the reduction of the turtle population. Live turtles entangled in fishing 
                       gears are also slaughtered by for flesh by the fishermen.     
                <br>
                <h3 id="h3">Kill for shell</h3>
                <img id="sub4" src="images/picture26.jpg" alt="pic4">
                <p>The highly endangered Hawksbill turtles have been killed in many parts of the world for its beautiful shell or carapace to provide raw material 
                 for the ‘’tortoise shell’’ trade. When scutes are removed from the shell, the turtle eventually dies. Synthetic fibres with similar colour patterns 
                 are now available to replace the tortoiseshell dies. Synthetic fibres with similar colour patterns are now available to replace the tortoiseshell 
                 raw materials for the good sake of hawksbill turtles.</p>

                 <h3 id="h3">Egg Collection</h3>
                 <p>One of the most widespread forms of marine turtle exploitation is the illegal poaching of turtle eggs . As female turtles come ashore to lay 
                 their eggs this makes a easy prey for egg collectors who take the eggs and sell them. All marine turtle nests on Sri Lankan beaches are robbed 
                 of their eggs except in places where conservation programmes are implemented. The eggs are either sold at markets for consumption or to turtle hatcheries.     
                <br>
                <h3>Turtle-by-catch</h3>
                <img id="sub5" src="images/picture28.jpg" alt="pic4">
                <p>Large number of marine turtles becomes victims of the modern fishing gear. Well over 0000 turtles are entangled annually in floating and bottom set 
                 gill nets in Sri Lanka. Shrimp trawling and fishing hooks with baits cause serious damages to marine turtles in other parts of the world.</p>

          <h3 id="h3">Non-Scientific Turtle Hatchery Practices</h3>
          <p>Once in the sea the hatchling swim constantly swim against the direction of the waves for a period of twenty four  hours without feeding 
           (Juvenile frenzy), During this period the hatchlings derive their nutrition from an internal, residual  yolk, an energy supply that is 
           exhausted at the end of the frenzy. Many hatcheries in Sri Lanka retain hatchling turtles in concrete tanks for at least three days as a 
           practice. When hatchling are kept in tanks for a longer period (e.g. 3-5 Days), the hatchlings spend the first one or two days constantly 
           swimming around the tanks without feeding.  On the third day the hatchlings’ behaviour changes to feeding behaviour and because they are 
           kept in tanks with many of their siblings. They begin to bite at each other. Some of the hatchlings receive injuries as a result, which 
           often become infected by bacteria and fungi, thus lowering the hatchlings’ chances of survival.

         <h3 id="h3">Habitat Distruction</h3>
         <img id="sub6" src="images/picture30.jpg" alt="pic4">
         <p>Important marine turtle habitats such as coral reefs, sea grass beds, mangroves, sand dunes and beach vegetations are been degraded by 
           man in many parts of the world due to over exploitation. Some of the major human activities that cause marine turtle habitat destruction 
           and alteration are briefly described below.</p>

          <h3 id="h3">Coral Mining</h3>
          <p>Coral reefs provide an important feeding and relaxing habitat for marine turtle as well as a vital protective barrier for the turtles’
            nesting beaches from sea erosion. Sri Lanka’s coral reefs are being destroyed by unsustainable harvesting.

         <img id="sub4" src="images/picture34.jpg" alt="pic4">
         <p>The removal of corals from reefs and sand from the beach increases the rate of beach erosion. The result will be the destruction of nesting habitats of marine turtles.</p>
